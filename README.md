# covid19-dashboard

Yet another covid19-dashboard

Okay, So this is a try out for adding scheduler to github actions for rendering a Rmd file to HTML dashboard.

And Voila! :tada: https://sksahu.net/covid19-dashboard/ (update automatically every 6 hours)

Data Source: https://github.com/pomber/covid19/ ([JSON](https://pomber.github.io/covid19/timeseries.json))

NOTE: Turnout github-actions scheduled workflows deactivate automatically with 60 days of no activity. (That's why this commit trying to reactivate it again)
